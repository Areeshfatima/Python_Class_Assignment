# Exception Handling with try, except, else, and finally
# Exception handling is a crucial part of writing robust Python programs. It allows you to handle errors gracefully and ensure your program doesn't crash unexpectedly.


# 1. The try Block
# The try block is used to test a block of code for errors. 
# If an error occurs within the try block, the program will immediately jump to the except block (if provided).

try:
    result = 10 / 0     # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except:
    print("An error occured!")


# The except Block
# The except block is used to handle specific errors that occur in the try block.
# You can specify the type of error to catch, or use a generic except to catch all errors.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can not divided by zero!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpexcted error occured: {e}")


# The else Block
# The else block is executed if no errors occur in the try block. 
# It is optional and is used for code that should only run when the try block is successful.

try:
    result = 10 / 5
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("cannot divided by zero!")
else:
    print(f"Division Successful:Result = {result}")

# The finally Block
# The finally block is executed regardless of whether an error occurred or not. 
# It is often used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can not divided by zero!")
finally:
    print("This will always excecute!")

print("\n----\n")

# What is NoReturn?
# NoReturn is a special type hint from Python's typing module. It is used to indicate that a function will not return normally. This means the function either:
# Always raises an exception,
# Enters an infinite loop,
# Or otherwise never reaches the end of the function body to return a value.

# Example: Using NoReturn

# When you call terminate_program, it never returns normally:
try:

    print(f"Program terminated: {se}")

# Alternative to NoReturn in Python
# NoReturn from the typing module is used to indicate that a function never returns normally. 
# However, if you donâ€™t want to use NoReturn, you have a few alternative approaches.

# Example: Using None
